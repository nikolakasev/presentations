VP of Innovation at AWS, 

Innovation by experimentation
Innovation must be able to fail
Willing to innovate, willing to fail
Experimentation proves that something is wrong (never that something is right) - Einstein proves dutch and Newton wrong about light in a straight line
Prior theories were proved incorrect
Let things fail so they can be falsified
How do we maintain the spirit of the great inventors vs. 5K author paper of large squadron collider?
Innovation@Amazon - two pizzas!
Assign two-pizza teams to work on innovation
When a decision must be made - one hour meeting - at the beginning 30 min they just read, let's discuss in the rest 30 min (forces to read the document)
When you write a sentence of prose, you have to decide what you need

Leadership principles:
**Customer obsession** - working backwards, write a press release to be released in the future and a FAQ, it acknowledges that it's impossible today, invent stuff that doesn't exist today, written in customer terms
Amazon Prime Air
Roughly 90-95% roadmap is driver by what customers tell them matters;
**Are wright, A Lot** - it's ok to be wrong, it's ok to experiment and fail at it, being wrong on occasion is perfectly fine
Leaders seek diverse perspectives and work to **disconfirm** their beliefs
We think long-term (willing to be misunderstood), build businesses that outlast us
**Deliver Results** - commitment to operational excellence, decentralized teams

Use the 6 page narrative - have the team that's proposing the decision write it, then read it (30 min.) and decide (30 min.)

Write a press release + FAQ, 18 months
